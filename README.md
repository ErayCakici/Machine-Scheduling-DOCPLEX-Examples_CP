# Scheduling-DOCPLEX-Examples_CP

Constraint programming formulations for different machine scheduling problems are provided in this repository. 

Optimization models are formulated in Python and solved with Cplex by using DOcplex Python Modeling API.

Problems addressed are: 
- Single machine scheduling to minimize weighted number of tardy jobs 
- Single machine scheduling to minimize maximum lateness (with release times)
